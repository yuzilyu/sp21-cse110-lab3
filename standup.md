**This is a template for daily standup. Teammates should aim for more than just filling out this template. Daily standups are crucial to the success of the team as it keeps everyone in the loop. We need to be aware of what we accomplished, what we have in mind, and what is blocking us from achieving our goals**

## Roadblock
